20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This LBV Port is powered by jammy damson and plum fruits along with dried figs and a juicy aftertaste. The palate is dry, with tannins just in evidence, although the balance is just right. Drink now. ",Delaforce 2011 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),89,20,Port,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This wine has richness, with fine tannins along with exuberant fruit. With its concentration and ripe berry flavors it has power as well as elegance. Juicy and packed with blackberry and damsons, it will be ready to drink from 2026. ",Quevedo 2015 Quinta Vale d'Agodinho Vintage  (Port),93,60,Port,Port
13.3%,Red,US,"This wine opens with aromas of ultraripe grapes, despite the relatively moderate listed alcohol. Baking spices, Christmas cake, plum pastry and almost Port-like flavors (without the alcoholic heat) suggest that very ripe grapes were included in the the mix of fruit. Drink up. ",Provincial Vineyards 2015 Cuvée Duo Estate Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),88,24,Oregon,Pinot Noir
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"The wine is rich, exuding ripe black fruits as well as dried prune. It balances the fruit with some firm tannins that will allow the wine to age for a few years. For now, it is opulent, finely balanced, and leaves a fine perfumed aftertaste from the Touriga Nacional in the blend. ",Offley 2013 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),90,26,Port,Port
14%,Red,France,"This estate, based in the Gironde port village of Lamarque, has produced a richly textured, chocolate and bitter-cocoa-flavored wine. That is only a problem at the moment, because ripe black-currant fruits are developing under the structure to give density, concentration and a serious wine as it ages. Drink from 2021. ",Château Malescasse 2015  Haut-Médoc,92,17,Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
15%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"This wine's butterscotch and toffee notes precede a citric palate that fails to capture the basics of good Fino: friendly, crisp and clean. This tastes of sour white fruit and citrus, with a hint of nuttiness. On the finish, it goes past crisp and snappy straight to sharp. ",Bodegas Barón NV Micaela Fino Sherry (Jerez),82,11,Andalucia,Sherry
17%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Smooth, rich and easy on the palate, this is a delicious, balanced Sherry. Its nutty, chocolate, mocha and almond flavors finish like a good cup of coffee. ",Pemartín NV Cream Sherry (Jerez),91,14,Andalucia,Sherry
20%,Port/Sherry,US,"This is made from a majority of Touriga Nacional, with smaller amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon and Tinta Roriz (Tempranillo), and spent nearly 11 years in neutral oak before being bottled in 2017. It appears to be in its prime, beautifully rich on the nose and palate, with integrated, off-dry flavors of candied orange and cherry. ",Prager NV Noble Companion 10-Year-Old Tawny Port (Napa Valley),94,80,California,Port
14%,Red,Portugal,"From a parcel of 45 different old-vine varieties planted mixed in the traditional way, this wine is bold, ripe and richly textured. Partly fermented in open stone lagars, it has a typical, almost Port-like character. Ripe black plums, rich tannins and a great structure all point to medium-term aging potential. Drink from 2022. ",Quinta do Vallado 2015 Reserva Field Blend Red (Douro),94,65,Douro,Portuguese Red
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"The wood-aged wine has retained its fruit in the manner of a 10-year-old tawny. While there are plenty of rich red fruits, there is also the layer of wood-aging toast and spice to give the wine an extra dimension. Like all tawnies, this wine is ready to drink. ",Poças 2008 Colheita  (Port),91,40,Port,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"The wine is dominated by big bold tannins that give a sense of great power. That produces a wine with a strong structure, and a dry edge that will need to soften. Drink this dark firm wine from 2028. ",Quinta do Vallado 2016 Adelaide Vintage  (Port),94,110,Port,Port
21%,Fortified,Portugal,"This is a rich, intense and dense wine. Aging in wood has concentrated the ripe fruit, bringing an old-gold character to the wine. It is supremely rich with flavors of molasses and also tight with great acidity. Drink this superb wine now. ",Cossart Gordon 1989 Bual Bual (Madeira),96,210,Madeira,Bual
18%,Port/Sherry,US,"An outstanding after-dinner drink, this wine has a tawny color along the rim and abundant nutty mapley apricot-like flavors. A combination of elevated alcohol, good acidity and firm tannins gives it a grip on the palate and contributes to a long tasty nutty finish. ",Meyer Family Cellars NV Port (California),90,35,California,Port
13.5%,Red,Portugal,This ripe wine is packed with attractive black fruits. Its light structure will  allow the wine to be drunk young to benefit from the fruitiness and mineral texture. Drink from 2020. ,Symington Family Estates 2016 Altano Naturalmente Red (Douro),87,12,Douro,Portuguese Red
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This is a rich, nutty wine, satisfyingly ripe, poised between sweet and dry. Its touch of spirit adds to the sweetness of the wine and balances with the acidity from wood aging. The wine is ready to drink. ",Dow's NV 10 Years Old Tawny  (Port),90,37,Port,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"The latest incarnation of this most famous of Late Bottled Vintage Ports has so many of the brand's characteristics. It is on the dry side, a balanced wine with acidity as well as the sweet black fruits and with some tannins to give the wine shape. The Port is bottled ready for drinking. ",Taylor Fladgate 2014 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),90,25,Port,Port
N/A,Red,Portugal,"A blend of five Douro grapes, several of which go into Port, this has a dusty nose and a palate of warm berries. It's a thick, jammy, pungent wine that expands in the mouth to catch all corners. Aged in French oak for about a year, this wine has the potential to age and become something special. ",Sogrape 1996 Reserva Red (Douro),87,13,Douro,Portuguese Red
N/A,White,Portugal,"An oddity for this bastion of red wines and Port, this unknown white happens to be downright good and is reminiscent of Bordeaux blanc; yet it's made from a blend of fairly obscure Portuguese white varietals. Extremely aromatic, floral and clean, it's loaded with green-apple and lees flavor. Slightly creamy with a pleasant texture, this is one to look for. ",Real Vinicola 1998 Porca de Murça Reserva Red (Douro),89,17,Douro,Red Blends
N/A,Red,US,"A ripe, alcoholic nose, with port-like, raisiny fruit. It seems a little sharp and thin on the palate at this point of its development, with alcohol and tannins overriding the fruit. ",Kenwood 1997 Jack London Vineyard Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),84,20,California,Zinfandel
14.5%,Red,US,"This is tough, chewy Zinfandel; fruity and one-dimensional, with overripe, port-like flavors. ",Norman 1997 The Monster Zinfandel (Paso Robles),84,18,California,Zinfandel
N/A,Red,US,"95-year-old vines produced this dark, inky, tannic wine made in the old style. Blueberries, vanilla and spice, with lots of depth and power. Good juice unimpeded by oak. ",Sonora 1997 TC Vineyard Old Vine Zinfandel (Amador County),86,19,California,Zinfandel
N/A,Red,US,"The flavors are almost moving into late-harvest; raisiny, superripe, hot and tannic. On the plus side is the finish, with sweet, juicy, jammy fruit that is really tasty. From 77-year-old vines. ",Sonora 1997 Story Vyd Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),86,19,California,Zinfandel
16.1%,Red,US,"The high alcohol (16.1%) indicates ripe, port-like fruit. Raisins and plums fill out a gamy, fat, seriously oaky monster. This is not food-friendly; it's really more of an after-dinner, Friday-night kind of wine. But if you like your Zinfandel over the top in all respects, this is your bottle. ",St. Francis 1997 Pagani Vineyard Reserve Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),88,39,California,Zinfandel
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Perhaps the major surprise is that one of the top wines is a single quinta Port from Sandeman, a house that, after a fairly lean period, is reaffirming its commitment to Vintage Port. This is luscious, rich, almost creamy in texture, with piles of black fruit, lavender and spice. ",Sandeman 1997 Quinta do Vau Port (Douro),93,38,Douro,Port
N/A,Red,US,"Has pretty Zin aromas. Rich and fruity, and becomes almost superripe in the midpalate, where raisiny, overextracted flavors kick in with Port-like intensity and heat. A big wine that's a little off-balance; finishes hot. ",Hidden Mountain Ranch 1997 Zinfandel (California),83,16,California,Zinfandel
13.9%,Red,US,"Heady aromas of plums, chocolate, blackberries and raisins. Flavors are fruity, and tannins are considerable, as is the oak. Although the alcohol is only 13.9 percent, it drinks a little like a Port—thick and chewy. Will seem cloying and out of balance to some; others will be thrilled. ",Kendall-Jackson 1996 Grand Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (California),89,74,California,Cabernet Sauvignon
20.5%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A full-bore tawny, it's still going strong, possibly too strong. Rosy in color, there's a faint odor of chlorine to go with the tea and spice aromas. Full-bodied, even a touch heavy. Spicy flavors along with apples, and some honey to the finish. Overall it's overdone. ",Quinta do Noval 1971 Colheita  (Port),85,40,Port,Port
N/A,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"What it lacks in smoothness it makes up for in its chocolaty creaminess and cream-soda flavors. Notes of cloves, licorice and spicy fruit will please anyone looking for a good, basic sipper. A tad clunky, but likable. ",Cockburn's NV 10 Years Tawny  (Port),85,25,Port,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"One of this esteemed house's basic Ports, and it's by no means hard to enjoy. Some strawberry and red fruit on the young, rubbery nose. Tangy, with the requisite sweetness in the form of brown sugar. There's a dark coffee note on the finish. ",Warre's NV King's Tawny  (Port),85,13,Port,Port
N/A,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Imagine brown sugar and raisins in liquid form. Not overly concentrated or complex, but thoroughly enjoyable. Mild tannins suggest this will be an early-maturing bottling. ",Martinez Gassiot 1995 Quinta da Chousa  (Port),86,40,Port,Port
N/A,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"All the basic berries and cream on the nose. Plush and rich, this is easy-drinking Port. Black plums and a big-time sweet core. Close to syrupy, but retains its balance. Smooth, well rounded, fruity and good. A nice dessert Port. ",Rozes 1994 Reserve Edition LBV  (Port),86,19,Port,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Quite floral, offering hints of violets and black cherries. A reserved style, with a narrow band of fruit flavors and some dusty tannins to resolve. Try in five years, but will always be more fragrant than flavorful. ",Warre's 1986 Quinta Da Cavadinha Port (Douro),87,42,Douro,Port
N/A,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Simple and straightforward, with a clean, creamy body. The aromas and flavors of cinnamon, walnuts and burnt caramel conjure up memories of crème brûlée. Solid, as is the house style, if basic. ",Rozes NV Infanta Isabel 10 Year Tawny  (Port),87,25,Port,Port
17.5%,Port/Sherry,Australia,"A nutty wine with brilliant fruit, made in a lighter tawny style. The wine, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Muscat, has a medium finish with a touch of dark plum at the end. Best Buy. ",Benjamin NV Tawny Port (South Eastern Australia),88,10,Australia Other,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A soft, aromatic tawny, with little to no aggressiveness. Flavors of oranges, caramel, nuts and chocolate make it more than easy to take. Almost nonexistent acidity yields a fluffy, almost hedonistic wine—yet it's only a 10-year-old. Best Buy. ",Feist NV 10 Years Old Port (Douro),89,19,Douro,Port
N/A,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Quite concentrated; filled with dark-fruit flavors that offer hints of coffee, licorice and chocolate. Its moderately tannic nature suggests cellaring 5–10 years before peak maturity. ",Martinez Gassiot 1995 Quinta da Eira Velha  (Port),89,43,Port,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Because it has been bottled without filtering, this Port has a chance to age. It has the opulent character of a Fonseca Port, enhanced by the fine vintage. Rich and full in the mouth, the wine's stewed blackberry and sweet plum flavors, both underlined by tannins, are sure to age well. Drink from 2021. ",Fonseca 2014 Late Bottled Vintage Unfiltered  (Port),91,24,Port,Port

19.5%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"While the aromas are somewhat medicinal, the palate shows touches of honey as well as acidity. It is an easygoing wine, with a bite of spirit at the end. ",Quinta Seara d'Ordens NV Fine White  (Port),85,12,Port,Port
19.5%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This fruity wine, with its smooth texture, is simple and easygoing. Its lightness balances the honeyed character that gives the wine a ripe aftertaste. ",Quinta Santa Eufemia NV Fine White  (Port),85,15,Port,Port
15.87%,Red,US,"Port-like aromas give this 100% varietal wine a sense of sweetness, the texture viscous in baked black fruit. The oak is supportive and present, adding weight and breadth. ",Rock Wall 2017 Hendry Vineyard Block 29 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),86,45,California,Zinfandel
14.7%,Red,US,"This superripe, almost Port-like wine exudes raisin and dried plum aromas and blackberry-jam flavors.

19.5%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,This dry wine is strongly influenced by the wood aging. It shows in the acidity and in the bursts of freshness that come through. The aftertaste is tight and almost bitter. ,Bulas NV Dry White 10 Anos  (Port),86,36,Port,Port

19.5%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Because this wine was bottled unfiltered, it certainly has a good chance of aging further.

14%,Red,Portugal,"Better known for its Ports, this stunning upper Douro quinta also makes small amounts of still wine.

13%,Red,US,"This unusually dark-colored and potent-smelling wine pumps out overripe pruney Port-style aromas and apparently sweet, jammy boysenberry flavors that are not at all typical for the varietal.

19.5%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"You get a glimpse of the fine qualities of the 1997 vintage in this bottling, which displays lush black cherry and plum aromas and flavors against a backdrop of supple tannins and a velvety texture. The elements are well integrated, and the finish is long and fruity. ",Dow's 1997 LBV Porto Port (Portugal),89,18,Portugal,Port
19%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Plums, dusty earth and dried spice mingle on the nose of this older release that actually seems more ageworthy than Portal's 1997 and 1999. It's supple, medium-weight wine, with plum, prune and spice flavors that finish with modest tannins and pleasing berry and spice notes. ",Quinta do Portal 1995 Vintage  (Port),89,33,Port,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"At 10 years of age, Portal's tawny is still showing some rough edges of youth; it's big and brawny, with plump cherry-berry fruit joined by citrus and caramel. A fine café au lait note comes through on the finish. ",Quinta do Portal NV Ten Year Old Aged Tawny Port  (Port),89,24,Port,Port
N/A,Red,US,"A sweet, flavorful Port-style dessert wine. Opens with enticing aromas of cassis, chocolate, caramel, vanilla and smoke. Rich and chocolatly in the mouth, with ripe flavors of currants that are backed up with bracing acidity. Delicious, with a long, sweet finish. ",Mitchell Katz Winery 2000 JK's Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),90,24,California,Cabernet Sauvignon
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A reasonably good buy in vintage Port, Silval is something of a second label for Quinta do Noval. It's less concentrated and suppler in the mouth than its sister wine, but still boasts compelling floral aromas allied to prune, berry and chocolate flavors. Worth trying a bottle before 2010. ",Quinta do Noval 2000 Silval Vintage  (Port),90,37,Port,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This 20-year-old shows some surprisingly youthful notes of red fruits along with layers of caramel, honey, maple syrup and walnuts.

20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This young vintage Port is quite big, with plenty of lush fruit and some herb and spice notes. It's also on the dry side for vintage Port, and it lacks the hulking tannins you might expect. Surprisingly ready to drink, even at this age. ",Quinta do Portal 1997 Vintage  (Port),90,54,Port,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Barros's tawnies are worth seeking out. This young example shows the house's signature smoky, nutty aromas but adds more fruity scents of raisins and prunes. Supple in the mouth, with a long, toffee-filled finish. ",Barros NV 10 Years Old  (Port),90,25,Port,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Portuguese-owned Port houses, such as Barros, have long made terrific tawnies. This version is smoky and minerally, with nuts and citrus peel. It's supple and not very sweet, with a freshness and vibrancy that belie its age. Peppery on the finish. ",Barros NV 20 Years Old  (Port),90,35,Port,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Intentionally made in a friendly, fruit-forward style, Vau doesn't disappoint in 2000. It delivers what we've come to expect from this relatively recent creation, lush blackberry and plum flavors backed by clove and spice. If you like your Ports young and fruity, try this one soon; its longevity is untested. ",Sandeman 2000 Vau Vintage  (Port),90,45,Port,Port
N/A,Red,US,"Kicks off with ultra-ripe aromas of prune, black cherry and spice. This is a sweet style-not quite Port- but still very fruity, with bright cherry and more spice on the palate. Not for everyone. ",Brochelle Vineyards 2001 Zinfandel (Paso Robles),83,30,California,Zinfandel
N/A,Red,US,"Not a great success this vintage due to the baked, Porty aroma, with its suggestion of caramelized raisins, and Port-like, alcoholic flavors. Turns tannic and hot on the finish. Lacks definition and delicacy, and seems to be a victim of the heat. ",Peirano 2001 Heritage Collection Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),84,18,California,Cabernet Sauvignon
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Although this bottle showed some fine flavors of roasted coffee and English toffee, it also had aromas of burnt fruit and decaying vegetation. A disappointing effort. ",Ramos-Pinto NV Quinta Do Bom Retiro 20-Year Tawny Port (Portugal),84,67,Portugal,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Quite amber; browner than most 20-year-old tawnies. Aromas of nougat and café au lait; also hints of mint that grow more pronounced on the palate, turning a bit lean and green. Finishes spicy and peppery. ",Sandeman NV Tawny 20 Years Old Port (Douro),84,48,Douro,Port

20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Earth, tar and burnt sugar aromas aren't all that appetizing, but the wine turns supple and smooth on the palate, adding caramel, toffee and white pepper to the flavor mix. ",Osborne NV 10 Years Old Tawny  (Port),84,25,Port,Port
14.5%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Boasts flavors of prune and plum, with hints of alcohol, clove and cinnamon, almost like a rum-soaked spice cake. A bit heavy and low-acid; could use more freshness. ",Ramos-Pinto 1999 Duas Quintas Reserva Especial Red (Douro),85,11,Douro,Red Blends

N/A,Red,US,"A Port-like style, fruity and sweet, with sharp acidity that adds more shock value than balance. Cherries, blackberries, plums and spice are at the core. Try this with a cigar or Stilton. ",Edmeades 2001 Zeni Vineyard Zinfandel (Mendocino Ridge),86,25,California,Zinfandel
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"An elegant, lightweight wine, with lots of dried spice and cocoa notes layered over slightly pruny fruit. Not the best vintage in the Douro and it shows in this wine. ",W. & J. Graham's 1996 Malvedos Vintage Porto Port (Portugal),86,42,Portugal,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Light in body and showing some alcohol, I suspect this is in a bit of awkward phase. Black cherry, plum and berry fruit is joined by a slightly underripe weedy note. The wine finishes short, with modest tannins. ",Ramos-Pinto 1997 Vintage  (Port),86,50,Port,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Clove, dried spices and plum-scented fruit on the nose; straightforward blackberry and plum flavors. It's reasonably rich and supple in the mouth, but doesn't seem to have a great deal of depth to support aging. ",Sandeman 2000 Vintage  (Port),86,60,Port,Port
N/A,Red,Portugal,"With its aromas of smoke, mineral, blackberries and blueberries, this Douro blend tastes like a dry Port—without the alcohol, tannins or sugar that relegate Port to the end of the meal. Drink now–2010. ",Roberedo Madeira 2000 Carm Classico Red (Douro),87,18,Douro,Red Blends
N/A,Port/Sherry,US,"Pretty good and tasty, a Port-style wine made from Cabernet Sauvignon. It has flavors of chocolate, creme de cassis and Kahlúa, and is sweet but not cloying. ",Cedar Mountain 1998 Cabernet Royale Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),87,25,California,Cabernet Sauvignon

20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Starts off a bit floral, then develops raspberry and chocolate nuances as it sits in the glass. Seems a bit light and hard-edged, with dry, unyielding tannins.

",Churchill's 2000 Quinta da Gricha Vintage Porto Port (Portugal),87,83,Portugal,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Nutty and earthy, with maple sugar flavors and just a hint of red-skinned fruit. Sweet and a bit simple, but satisfying nonetheless. ",Smith Woodhouse 1976 Colheita Single Year Tawny Port (Douro),87,43,Douro,Port
16.5%,Red,Italy,"A rich, hedonistic wine. The nose is Port-like, with resounding depth in addition to strong scents of prune and chocolate. The palate has an almost Bourbon-like quality to it; it's that rich and warm. And the finish is soft and plush, with bitter chocolate and espresso flavors. ",Raimondi 1997  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,91,53,Veneto,Red Blends
N/A,Red,Portugal,"Boasts a huge nose of blackberries and vanilla, with hints of blueberries and tobacco. The flavors capture the essence of Port in their untamed, effusive berry flavors, but in a balanced, dry wine. Firm tannins suggest cellaring 3–5 years. ",Prats & Symington LDA 2001 Chryseia Red (Douro),91,45,Douro,Red Blends
N/A,Red,US,"Puts out hot country scents of baked cherry pie, pie crust, and tar, and those hot notes continue in the mouth. There's something Port-like in the raisiny flavors and thick texture. Turns semi-sweet on the finish. ",Vino Con Brio 2000 Pinotage (Lodi),82,20,California,Pinotage
15%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"This is not a crisp, lean, clear fino. It has a yellowing color and rather uncommon minty, nutty aromas. Some light fruit flavors run the show, while blanched almond, green olive and saline offer support. The finish is long, but maybe a bit sour and hot for some palates. Still, it's quite interesting and well made, and probably a good match with the right food. ",Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Fino Sherry Sherry (Jerez),88,15,Andalucia,Sherry
18%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Rich and pure, with warm saddle-leather aromas as well as scents of toffee and hard cheese. The palate runs sweet and rich, with plenty of brown sugar and spice galore. As a whole it's a rather forward and approachable wine that might lack some complexity but not exuberance. ",Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Amontillado Sherry Sherry (Jerez),89,17,Andalucia,Sherry
18%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"This sweetie is powerful yet smooth, with almond paste and coffee aromas along with a mild sharpness that lends focus. Flavors of chocolate, brown sugar and baked apples burst forth from the thick and creamy palate, while the finish, which runs a little short, is flavorful and comes with a mushroom accent. A sure-fire hit with desserts. ",Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Cream Sherry Sherry (Jerez),90,17,Andalucia,Sherry
19%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Sweet and plump in the nose, with a hint of caramel corn, burnt sugar and char. Flavors of walnuts, dried apricots and citrus peel carry the palate, while the lasting and tasty finish delivers the works in terms of toffee, mocha and raisins. More fruity than many, with a touch of mushroom. ",Osborne NV 10RF Oloroso Medium Sherry Sherry (Jerez),90,14,Andalucia,Sherry
20%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Quite the classic, with rich toffee and nut-like aromas that come through with piercing power. The briny palate is all about dried citrus and nuts, while the earthy, long finish has an unmistakable and very nice mushroom quality. This is a precise, somewhat reserved and dainty amontillado, but it's structured and quite real as far as style and impact. ",Sandeman NV Royal Esmeralda Fine Dry Amontillado Sherry (Jerez),91,25,Andalucia,Sherry
18%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"The people at Hidalgo in Sanlúcar have taken dry Manzanilla and have let it age until it has turned golden and mature. The bouquet is full of exotic oils, nuts and some horsehide. In the mouth, it's a touch salty and astringent, but there are buttery, sweet undertones and great focus. And on the back end the pure flavor of mushroom and almonds is uncanny. Sleek, acidic and likely perfect with lobster or shrimp bisque. ",Vinícola Hidalgo NV Pastrana Manzanilla Pasada Sherry (Jerez),92,18,Andalucia,Sherry
18%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"More sweet than semi-sweet, and very stylish. The nose offers a full blast of maple, citrus rind and honey, while the delicious palate overflows with dried apricot, fig, dates, pepper and chocolate. This is a sherry that excels in the area of mouthfeel: it's lithe, almost lean, but still packed and upright. And the finish, which is just spicy enough to offset the sweetness, goes on forever. ",Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Oloroso Sherry Sherry (Jerez),93,17,Andalucia,Sherry
20%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Rich and unctuous; a big, muscular, semi-sweet beauty with a meaty frame and gorgeous maple and toffee aromas. Broad-shouldered across the palate, with apricot and quince flavors accented by cinnamon and nutmeg. In terms of mouthfeel, it's like a fine liqueur, and on the finish everything you've previously smelled and/or tasted comes back into perfect focus. ",Sandeman NV Royal Corregidor Rich Old Oloroso Sherry (Jerez),94,25,Andalucia,Sherry
17%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"A spectacularly sweet and rich bruiser, and one that delivers the essence of raisins, toffee and chocolate. This wine hasn't taken one turn south, and it's beckoning to be consumed. The finish is impeccably smooth and rich, and while its luscious to say the least, the amazing thing is its length, which runs a couple of minutes, no joke. A guarantee for anyone who loves the hedonistic combination of sweet fruit, brown sugar and chocolate. ",Osborne NV Pedro Ximenez 1827 Sweet Sherry Sherry (Jerez),94,14,Andalucia,Sherry
N/A,Red,US,"A wine that tastes like cheap Port. Smells caramelly and tastes overtly sweet, with berry flavors framed in tough, rugged tannins. Could be any red varietal under the sun. ",Shenandoah 2000 Rezerve Sangiovese (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),82,24,California,Sangiovese
N/A,Port/Sherry,US,"Awkward, opening with vegetal aromas that turn cloyingly sweet in the mouth. It's also a very acidic wine. Not offering much charm now. ",Renwood 1995 Vintage Port Port (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),83,22,California,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,US,"Made from true Port grape varieties, this wine shares many characteristics with a vintage-style Port.

",Cedar Mountain 1997 Vintage Port (Amador County),87,21,California,Port
N/A,Red,US,"Here's an absolutely classic Paso Zin. It brims with the juiciest wild berry and jam flavors, big and bold, wrapped in ultrasoft tannins and set off by low acids.

N/A,Dessert,US,"From one of the pioneering families of this endangered appellation in greater L.A., a true old-style California Port.

N/A,Red,US,"An awkward Cabernet whose Port-like elements make it disagreeable. It opens with aromas of raisins and vinyl, and turns fiery on the tongue. This is perhaps not surprising from a winery whose specialty is Port. ",Cedar Mountain 1999 Blanches Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),81,22,California,Cabernet Sauvignon
N/A,Red,US,"A very ordinary wine that starts off with wobbly Cabernet aromas that veer into Port and raisins, and then turn too sweet in the mouth. ",Bent Creek 2000 Cabernet Sauvignon (Livermore Valley),82,20,California,Cabernet Sauvignon
N/A,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A Port that is close to a classic vintage Port in quality, because Niepoort makes a traditional style of LBV, which can age in the bottle.

N/A,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"The extra year's wood aging has given this wine great depth of flavor and richness.

",Cálem 1997 LBV Bottled 2002 Port (Douro),90,23,Douro,Port
N/A,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A rich, sweet wine, this is typical of the wonderfully powerful Fonseca style. The fruit is enormous and black, with sweet chocolate and ripe tannins.

N/A,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Gould Campbell, one of the smaller Port houses owned by the Symington family, is often underrated. But it shouldn't be, as this LBV shows.

N/A,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Warre's LBV is a crusted, traditional style, which has been bottled unfiltered and which matures in the bottle. That's why this wine is so fine and rich and only now reaching maturity. It is dry, with layers of tannins and dried fruit flavors.

14.8%,Red,US,"From a vineyard east of San Francisco, a wine that tastes like it baked under the heat and produced raisined berries.

14.6%,Red,US,"An inky black, thick wine that feels like Port in the mouth, with alcohol and heat carrying dark berry flavors. Acidity is pretty high, which adds to sense of heat and bitterness. ",Rosenblum 2000 Carla's Vineyards Zinfandel (San Francisco Bay),85,29,California,Zinfandel
15.2%,Red,US,"The appellation implies cool conditions, but the vineyard is in hot Oakley, which gives the fruit some overripe, Port-like notes.

14.7%,Red,US,"One of the darker wines of the year, and heady to sniff. You'd swear it was Port, with those big plummy aromas.

15.5%,Red,Italy,"Some clove and cardamom notes add character to the toasty, barrel-driven nose. In the mouth, rich black cherry and blackberry flavors seem as though they were infused with some brandy or Port. The finish is all fruit, so much so that one reviewer called the wine a fruit ball that departs from tradition. Still it's ripe, healthy and should age for quite some time.

15.5%,Red,Italy,"Interesting aromatics like sandalwood, violets and bitter herbs make this wine a bit out of the ordinary but no less likable.

13.9%,Red,US,"“Sweet” is the operative word with this wine. In the nose, a certain baked berry pie note mixes with bacon and chocolate.

20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Light in color, refined in the nose, and intense in the mouth. It's packed with toffee, nuts, dried apricot and other delicious and sophisticated flavors.

N/A,Red,US,"The brawniest of Hunt's releases, it borders on Port-like, with 14.7% alcohol and a burst of plummy, raisiny fruit. Other notes include char, smoke and a caramelized, pie-crust scent.

N/A,Red,US,"From Chiles Valley, a heady wine with 15.3% alcohol that will appeal to fans of superripe Zin.

14%,Red,US,"This offers a lot, maybe too much, of everything—supermature pruney fruit, tons of smoky oak and a jammy mouthfeel. It's fat, and closes long with dense fruit and black pepper accents. It's also over the top—overripe, highly extracted, densely wooded; if you love that style, you'll enjoy this much more than our tasters did. This has potential as a Port, though, consumed at the end of a meal with cheeses and nuts. ",Per Sempre 1999 The Lisa Shiraz (Napa Valley),85,60,California,Shiraz
N/A,Red,France,"Plenty of cedar and almost Port like notes of cooked fruit, tobacco and clove show on the nose of this balanced, medium-weight wine.

N/A,Red,US,"Smells forward and ripe, with wild berry, bramble, and blueberry aromas and an array of crushed, dust oriental Spices.

N/A,Red,US,"There are pruny, raisiny notes in the aroma, faintly Port-like, and this impression of super-maturity is confirmed in the mouth.

N/A,Red,US,"You can taste the earth, heat and sunshine in this strong and slightly sweet Zin.

N/A,Red,US,"Dark and deep purple/black, with a Port-like nose. There's a little fizz on the palate, which seems odd in a wine this big, and the flavors are locked in tight. Flat, dry, tannic finish. ",Sonora 1998 TC Vineyard Old Vine Zinfandel (Amador County),84,21,California,Zinfandel
N/A,Port/Sherry,US,"A blend of Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, fortified with brandy and aged in oak has yielded a young gawky wine that tastes like you would expect: sweet cassis and plum fruit is married to plenty of vanilla and menthol oak. Hints of chocolate emerge on the finish. Light tannins and low acidity make this a Port that's made to drink soon, not for the extended aging of traditional vintage Ports. ",Pindar Vineyards 1997 Port (Long Island),86,25,New York,Port
15.6%,Red,US,"A chewy wine with tremendous extraction and flavor intensity, this has some Port-like qualities, and the flavors are tart-sweet, pruney, with nutty, almost bitter almond notes peeking through. Still young, it will be better in two years. Coses with a big, tooth-staining finish. ",Rancho Zabaco 1999 Chiotti Vineyard Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),88,22,California,Zinfandel
13.5%,Red,Australia,"Opens deep and inky with prune, licorice, chocolate, Asian spices and a touch of leather. If you think that's a lot of nose for a $13 Shiraz, you're right.

13.5%,Red,Australia,"This wine's sweet edge will please those who haven't yet grown to appreciate complex Cabs. Aromas of mushrooms and wet soil burn off to reveal a sugary, grapey bouquet.

13.5%,Red,Australia,"This tawny-black Riverland offering has a Port-like bouquet of stewed fruit, mulling spices and smoked meat. Superripe (perhaps overripe) blackberry fruit stars in the mouth, with ancho chile and black pepper flavors in supporting roles.

13%,Red,Australia,"Lighter and more red-fruited than most Australian Cabs, Port-like qualities show in this wine's tawny hues and cherry, burnt sugar and earth bouquet. A mouth of slightly overripe berry fruit and the creamy, smooth texture are appealing, as is the attractively sweet, slightly hot finish. It's unusual, but that's not a bad thing.

14%,Red,Australia,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon wine shows why Cab is the grape that made Coonawarra famous. Dense and Port-like in color, the full nose displays cassis, fruit, leather, tobacco, green olive and eucalyptus. Rich and supple on the palate, it still has plenty of backbone. The extracted black cherry flavors, accented by green olive, sun-dried tomato and mint, sit atop some firm tannins. It finishes long, but a little hard, and could use a few years in the cellar. ",Punters Corner 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra),89,27,South Australia,Cabernet Sauvignon
13%,Red,Australia,"The dark cherry currant and cocoa fruit has an overripe, candied quality. It's wrapped in deep caramel-toasted oak, and has a plump, rather sappy feel.

12.5%,Red,Argentina,"The berry–rhubarb fruit here shows a dry, sour note and also a slight mustiness. The mouthfeel is even and the wine has balance—it's not too short or too sharp—There's just not enough material here. Pepper and meat notes show on the short finish. ",Escalera al Sol 1999 Syrah (Mendoza),83,6,Mendoza Province,Syrah
13.5%,Red,US,"Very ripe—some tasters felt overtly overripe—aromas and flavors gave this wine a Port-like character. Prunes, figs and nuts, a supple, low-acid mouthfeel, and a long sweet-and-sour finish comprise an interesting, but not universally enjoyed package. A split decision, and very much a personal call. ",Monterra 1998 Syrah (Monterey),84,13,California,Syrah
13.8%,Red,US,"Briary berry, herb and vanilla aromas and flavors define this medium-weight, balanced wine. There are almost Port-like notes and white pepper accents on the palate, with a soft mouthfeel.

N/A,Red,France,"What a nose. La Belle Marguerite's the color of ruby Port, so we shouldn't have been surprised at the luscious black currant, plum, black pepper and membrillo-paste aromas it showed. Cracked black pepper and curry notes spice up the palate's cherry, fresh red pepper and mineral flavors. Racy and medium-bodied, it finishes with more spice, plus some dried cherry notes.

N/A,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A lush, silky mouthfeel; bright berries come through the otherwise dark coffee- and chocolate-scented fruit to add interest.

16.8%,Red,US,"This is a bone-dry late-harvest Zinfandel made at the limits of dry red wine, with nearly 17% alcohol.

N/A,Red,US,"Released after more than four years in barrel, this Bordeaux blend is just beginning to shed its aggressive tannins.

15.5%,Red,US,"Ponderous aromas of Port, kirsch and cassis waft up from this 15.5% alcohol monster. This isn't Dolcetto in the Piemontese style.

13.5%,Red,Australia,"Impressive for sheer mass and the enormity of its fruits and spices, which makes it taste almost like fruitcake or a dry Port.

13.9%,Red,US,"Packed in upfront, with some atypical grassy, wildflower aromas. Chunky fruit and Port-like flavors make a statement, as does a black-tea note on the finish.

13.4%,Red,US,"Some sweetness in the form of kirsch and Port, as well as chocolate and the clear essence of wood shavings. At only 53% Cabernet, there's lots of Merlot-influenced red fruit.

13.8%,Red,US,"Full-priced, full-bodied, and the full complement of just about all you want in a Rutherford Cab.

18.4%,Port/Sherry,US,"A blend of five traditional Port varieties, this is a sweet (10% residual sugar), very rich wine of substance and harmony. It has massive flavors of berries with sweet overlays of caramel, chocolate and mint, and the sugars are nicely balanced by crisp acidity, although the texture is soft and velvety.

13.5%,Red,Spain,"There's no denying the wine's raisiny ripeness; it's confirmed via Sherry/Port aromas and black plum/baked fruit flavors. But it's not simply a heavyweight on its last legs. To the contrary, the wine delivers a jolt of core intensity and finishing notes of spicy black pepper and licorice. Drink right away. ",Marqués de la Concordia 2004 Reserva  (Rioja),88,19,Northern Spain,Tempranillo
19%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Caramel, molasses and spice aromas make this a totally approachable and familiar type of Sherry. The palate offers a round but zesty attack, with flavors of caramel, coffee, toffee, baked apple and orange peel. For the most part it's racy and fresh, but finishing mushroom and pepper notes give it added character. ",Osborne NV Premium Oloroso Medium 10RF Sherry (Jerez),90,16,Andalucia,Sherry
17.5%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"A new take on Harveys Bristol Cream. Instead of you adding a twist of orange with the final pour, they've done it for you. But as with many infused drinks, the aromas are kind of artificial and the flavors run straight to candied and never come back. Worth a go if you like orange as a lead flavor—serve on the rocks. ",Harveys NV Orange Apéritif Sherry (Jerez),84,15,Andalucia,Sherry
19.5%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Welcome back to the classic off-dry Sherry that helped make the category's reputation. It's amber in color, with toasted almonds, citrus peel and cinnamon on the nose. The mouthfeel is solid and not too overtly sweet, and the finish is coated with burnt brown sugar. Best served on the rocks, or at least with a very good chill. ",Williams & Humbert NV Drysack Medium Sherry (Jerez),87,15,Andalucia,Sherry
15%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"A unique take on Manzanilla Sherry, which is often light and sea-flecked but in this case is more amber, hazy and full. The nose is racy and spicy, while the palate offers dried apricots, orange peel and salt. Finishes with tang offsetting hazelnut and walnut notes. Oily, interesting and very good if you are a Sherry fan. ",Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Manzanilla Sherry (Jerez),90,10,Andalucia,Sherry
15.4%,Red,Chile,"This is a real heavyweight. At 15.4% alcohol it tastes and smells like Port, and it has a flat and chewy palate of raisin, baked black fruit and licorice candy. Basically, there's just no edge or balance to this mammoth, overripe fruit ball. ",Peñalolen 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),83,18,Maipo Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Surprisingly light and soft, for a Dow Port, this shows sweet fruit with a super-ripe edge. In the medium-term, this will be a pleasant, ripe vintage, but it's not likely to age. ",Dow's 2005 Quinta da Senhora da Ribeira Vintage  (Port),87,60,Port,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A joint venture with the van Zeller and Symington families, this is a surprisingly airy, light wine which seems to miss weight and depth. Sweetness, black figs, lean. ",Quinta de Roriz 2004 Vintage  (Port),87,54,Port,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"On the outside this is all soft, generous round fruit. In the core, though, there is a strong acid, perfumed fruit character, which suggests aging potential. Now the two components need to come together. ",Quinta do Noval 2005 Silval Vintage  (Port),88,55,Port,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Soft, superripe wine, with layers of sweet black figs and chocolate. This is almost like a Porty Zinfandel in its richness. There are tannins there, but they seem lost in this riot of sweet fruit. ",Rozes 2003 Vintage  (Port),88,80,Port,Port
N/A,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A good choice for current consumption, the 1985 Dow's shows a touch of bricking to go along with developed aromas of cedar, clove and cinnamon.

20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"From a vineyard opposite Quinta do Vesuvio, high up the Douro, this Symington-owned property has produced a rich, sweet 2004, with a soft tannic structure, layered with a lightly spirit edge. It's a big mouthful of ripe fruit. ",Dow's 2004 Quinta da Senhora da Ribeira Vintage  (Port),89,57,Port,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A classic, structured, well-shaped Port with its attractive dry tannins and firm, dark berry fruit.

20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Fruity, lacking the power of some vintages of Vargellas, but more than making up with richness, sweetness and delicious violet perfumes.

20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"A dry, structured wine, firm and with tannic, concentrated fruit. Spirit and acidity are both evident, but with its dark, brooding style this is an impressive return to form by Croft. ",Croft 2004 Quinta da Roêda Vintage  (Port),91,45,Port,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This is a superlative vineyard, and this wine shows its true character, a big, hearty wine, but one with a structured core of mineral, rich fruits and dark tannins.

18%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"If at first the wine seems sweet and scattered, just give it time. Soon the nose will knit together to show mocha and that lightly oxidized elegance that is Oloroso. After that there's a palate of coffee, caramel and brown sugar, and a tight, grabby palate that's like your tongue is attached to a magnet. Give this one plenty of air for best results. ",Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Oloroso Sherry (Jerez),91,18,Andalucia,Sherry

N/A,Port/Sherry,Australia,"Dark amber in color, with some greening evident at the rim, this Tokay features aromas of scorched coffee and Guinness stout-like flavors, but is also sweet, with hints of molasses and raisins.

19.5%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Smooth and nutty, with deep secondary aromatics of apricot and orange peel. For a dry, aged Sherry, you can't object to the wine's intense citrus core and outlying toffee and hazelnut flavors. And then on the finish come those classic mushroom and bitter chocolate notes. A real dandy made for connoisseurs more than novices. ",Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV 20 yr. Baco Imperial Amontillado Sherry (Jerez),92,90,Andalucia,Sherry

17%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Ultra concentrated and sticky, with unctuous but wholesome raisin aromas taken to a level that's almost heavenly.

18%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"This is sweet Amontillado in fine form. The nose is centered around a core of molasses and brown sugar, while the palate bubbles with maple and toffee.

",Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Amontillado Sherry (Jerez),93,20,Andalucia,Sherry
N/A,Port/Sherry,Australia,"Befitting its age, this wine is dark coffee in color, changing to greenish at the rim. Flavors are malty and molasses-like, accented by scents of burnt coffee and sugar. This is broad, mouthcoating and sweet—an authoritative expression of Rutherglen Rare Tokay. ",Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Rare Muscadelle Tokay (Rutherglen),93,300,Victoria,Tokay
N/A,Port/Sherry,Australia,"This is dark, almost black in color at the center, with greening evident at the rim. Syrupy, intense aromas of coffee and dark chocolate make an immediate impact on the nose, followed by syrupy, intense flavors of coffee and molasses. There's mind-boggling concentration here, but just enough acidity to provide a sense of balance. Still, it's hard to imagine drinking more than a couple of ounces of this at a time. ",R.L. Buller & Son NV Calliope Rare Muscat (Rutherglen),94,86,Victoria,Muscat
N/A,Port/Sherry,Australia,"This Muscat is the color of dark coffee, with a greenish inflection at the rim, showing the high average age of the blend.

A wine you can still taste minutes after spitting or swallowing. ",Chambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Rare Muscat (Rutherglen),95,300,Victoria,Muscat
N/A,Port/Sherry,Australia,"This wine has the rich hue of dark coffee in the glass, greening a bit at the rim.

",Campbells NV Merchant Prince Rare Muscat (Rutherglen),97,85,Victoria,Muscat
18%,Port/Sherry,Australia,"Campbells utilizes a modified solera system, so small portions of this blend are 60 or more years of age, imparting an incredibly elegant note of rancio.

13.3%,Red,Argentina,"Port, anyone? This is a prune-filled, raisiny wine. Naturally, it lacks balance and mouthfeel, which is replaced by a grating, starchy feel. Overall it has a few redeeming qualities and an okay finish. ",Medanos 2005 Tempranillo (Mendoza),81,14,Mendoza Province,Tempranillo
13.5%,Red,US,"Smells like an inexpensive Port, with roasted fruit, caramelized aromas. While the wine itself is not sweet, it tastes one-dimensional and hot, even though the official alcohol is moderate. ",California's Jewel 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),81,10,California,Cabernet Sauvignon
15%,Red,US,"Too hot and harsh by far. The blackberry and cherry fruit has a baked, stewed taste that finishes with searing, peppery heat. It's basically Port without the sweetness. ",Four Vines 2005 Biker Zinfandel (Paso Robles),82,24,California,Zinfandel
15%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"“Light” is misleading, because this really isn't a light fino at all. In fact, it's rather heavy and clunky, with a salty undercurrent to its lemon and nut flavors. Tastes more cooked than ideal. ",Harveys NV Fino Light Sherry (Jerez),83,15,Andalucia,Sherry

19%,Dessert,US,"Made from Petite Sirah, with residual sugar of 8.5%, this wine's sweetness is pleasing, expressed through cassis, chocolate and raspberry fruit flavors.

16%,Dessert,France,"Superripe Grenache gives this fortified dessert wine (16% alcohol) distinctly chocolaty overtones, but there's also an overripe note of prunes. Despite that, it doesn't pack the alcoholic punch or massive weight of Port, making it relatively easy to drink, with an affinity for chocolate desserts.

18.5%,Red,US,"This Zin comes in a half-bottle, and the alcohol is a Port-like 18.5%. It's a sweet wine, with sugary flavors of cherry pie filling, raspberry tart, chocolate and cassis-infused crème brûlée, finished with a crisp dose of acidity.

18%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Any fan of sweet Sherry should not turn a cheek against this jammy, figgy, rich wine that could use a cut of ice and citrus peel but isn't at all bad on its own.

18%,Port/Sherry,Australia,"This widely available, bargain-priced tawny remains an Australian classic, offering toffee and walnut aromas and flavors along with dust-covered leather and just a hint of fresh fruit.

",Hardys NV Whiskers Blake Classic Tawny Port (South Eastern Australia),88,13,Australia Other,Port
19%,Port/Sherry,Australia,"Medium amber in color, this Muscat boasts scents of berries, pineapple and raisin to go with flavors of honey and spice.

17%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"It's easy to throw high scores at almost any well-made P.X. because the wines are so viscous and overwhelmingly sweet. And while this one fits that bill, it has a couple of holes in it, namely a nose that stumbles out of the gate and a mouthfeel that's almost too thick and rich. Very nice but not at that ultrahigh level. ",Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Pedro Ximénez (Jerez),89,15,Andalucia,Pedro Ximénez

19%,Dessert,US,"Made from traditional Port varieties, this 11 year-old wine has achieved a soft, nutty silkiness, although it still contains fine, crisp acids and smooth tannins.

17%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"Pure and unblocked by anything other than raisin, maple and brown sugar aromas and flavors.

18%,Port/Sherry,Australia,"This wine shows its age in the dark coffee color rimmed with green.

18%,Port/Sherry,Spain,"The first whiff yields mostly raisins, but subsequent sniffs force up lush caramel and malt notes along with a blast of molasses. Cream Sherries by nature are sweet, and this one fits the bill with the full allotment of fig, date and carob flavors. Mocha and espresso on the finish cement this wine's pedigree. Great if you have a sweet tooth and fine even if you don't. ",Bodegas Dios Baco S.L. NV Cream Sherry (Jerez),90,18,Andalucia,Sherry
18%,Port/Sherry,Australia,"Buller's top wines are from Rutherglen, but this entry-level Tokay carries the broader Victoria GI.

Buller & Son NV Premium Fine Tokay (Victoria),90,16,Victoria,Tokay
N/A,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"With its dark gold color, this fits the part of an aged, vintage-dated tawny even before tasting.

14%,Red,Australia,"Smells almost Port-like, with expansive aromas of fruit cake, maple syrup and chocolate, then delivers a similar array of flavors, although completely dry. Full-bodied, lush and richly textured, this is almost too much, although the intriguing spice notes of cinnamon, clove and allspice help rein in the waves of chocolate and dried fruit.

N/A,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"With its inky dark color, this is darkly dense, a huge mouthful of black fruits and dark, initially medicinal flavors and firm, concentrated tannins.

N/A,Red,Australia,"A blend of 80% Shiraz and 20% Cabernet, this rich, almost Port-like wine also shows a slight herbal note—enough to give it some lift and complexity.

N/A,Red,Australia,"From a single vineyard in the Ebenezer region, this is simply stupendous stuff. It is a bit Port-like in its rich layers of blackberry fruit, but it also displays great freshness and drive, giving it a juicy, fresh fruit character that's accented even more by dustings of pepper and dried spices. A beautiful marriage of drinkability and ageability; drink now–2020. ",Glaetzer 2005 Amon-Ra Unfiltered Shiraz (Barossa Valley),95,80,South Australia,Shiraz
N/A,Port/Sherry,Australia,"Thought to be a blend of Shiraz, Grenache and Mourvèdre, although some of the older components could conceivably contain traces of other varieties. The average age of the components is 40 or 45 years, and the wine's color reflects that age, being amber at the center and fading to a greenish tinge at the rim. Toffee and coffee notes permeate the wine, which boasts lovely rounded edges, honey and a bit of dried apricot. Rich, with a long finish ending on lingering rancio notes.

14.5%,Red,US,"This winery has been working for years with Barbera, but it's a tough grape to perfect in California.

N/A,Red,US,"The nose is volatile and pruney, the color dark, almost Port-like. The wine is very soft and flat.

14.5%,Red,US,"Almost as sweet as a Port, this has sugary flavors of very ripe blackberries and cassis. Nothing wrong with that, except that it's not really a dry table wine.

N/A,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This is too young to have the true taste of a vintage-dated Colheita. It is almost a young tawny, both in color and taste.

This showed masses of dried fruit and maple syrup flavors, all of which seemed to dry up a bit on the finish to reveal spice, alcohol and a certain degree of austerity.

",Warre's 1999 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),91,28,Port,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Sandeman's aged tawnys have a definite dryness, the wood an important part of the wine. While they are dry, the weight of rich, dried fruit flavors gives a good balance.

20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Old Colheitas are often only sipping wines, ones to admire. That's the case here, because there is a medicinal character that comes from extreme concentration.

17.5%,Port/Sherry,Australia,"For a vintage-style fortified, this wine's color is appropriately intense and dark, but the tannins are somewhat tame.

20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"The wood and toasty character of this mature Port is just right. It has a fine balance between its old gold flavors and the spirit, giving an intense, concentrated character. Hints of fruitiness are still, just there.

20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Bright, ripe red plums predominate in this wine that tastes very young, intensely fruity and veering towards dryness.

20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"While the wine is showing the spirit strongly, that doesn't detract from the good acidity and dried-fruit flavors. It has kept much of its freshness, still hinting at red fruits, while the wood aging provides great support. The aftertaste, with its aromatic acidity, is just right. ",Royal Oporto NV Quinta das Carvalhas 10-Year-Old Tawny  (Port),88,30,Port,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This has quite a bite with acidity and a strong cut of spirit. Flavors of dried raisins and sultana put it on the dry side of aged tawny.

20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"It takes a while for this wine to make its presence felt. It is dry, reticent in its favors, hinting at fruitiness.

20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"This ripe and sweet wine has only light acidity. That gives it a soft, light character, emphasizing fruitiness rather than the wood aging of an old tawny. The aftertaste is round and soft. ",Dalva NV Presidential 10-Years-Old Tawny  (Port),85,10,Port,Port

13.5%,Red,US,"This well-aged release definitely falls on the ripe-to-the-point-of-raisins side of the fruit spectrum. It's almost Port-like, with flavors of blackberry pie and coffee.

14%,Red,Portugal,"The second wine of Quinta do Vesúvio, Pombal is still concentrated and dense from low yielding vines.

20.9%,Port/Sherry,US,"Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel and Syrah wine that's been aged seven years in French oak and fortified with four-year-old Charbay Syrah brandy, this vintage selection is aromatically stunning in chocolate, tobacco and dried ginger candy notes. Balanced and rich, it finishes semidry, with a viscous taste of almonds and dried cranberries, both of which would make a good pairing, atop a selection of gooey cheeses. ",Charbay 2006 Still House Port (Napa Valley),93,50,California,Port
14%,Red,Portugal,"This is an immense wine, seriously ageworthy and still very young. It is powered by the dark tannins and concentrated fruits that come from the old vines at this iconic quinta.

20.9%,Port/Sherry,US,"Aged seven years in French oak, this is made from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and then fortified with six-year-old, barrel-aged Cabernet Franc brandy. Very little is made. The experience is stellar, the dark-brown-red-hued wine opulent in red candy apple, chocolate and raspberries with ample acidity and a nuttiness to the finish. The pairing suggestion of a cigar is exactly right, though the wine will dance with nuts and cheeses or a decadent cheesecake too. ",Charbay 2006 Distillers' Port (Napa Valley),94,75,California,Port
20%,Port/Sherry,Portugal,"Properly old gold in color, this is a wine from a single year, aged in casks.

18.5%,Dessert,Israel,"If blackberry preserves and black licorice were made into a wine, this would be it. While Yarden's T2 dry blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Cao is a very good wine, this sweet Port-style wine misses the mark. With a nose of blackberry preserves, cassis and rose petal—and flavors of blackberry, cassis, licorice and clove—it should be gorgeous in the mouth. However, the overall sweetness is cloying without necessary balance. ",Golan Heights Winery 2009 Yarden T2 Touriga Nacional-Tinta Cao Red (Galilee),84,44,Galilee,Red Blends
15.5%,Red,US,"Here's an excellent example of a dry Zinfandel that doesn't need to drink like a Port in terms of its balance. The aromas are subtle, suggesting blackberries, but the flavors go deep into more blackberries, ripe red cherries and Santa Rosa plums accented with just a dash of cinnamon-like oak. This is full-bodied yet deceptively smooth and elegant in texture. ",Jessie's Grove 2011 Westwind Old Vine Zinfandel (Lodi),91,32,California,Zinfandel
15.5%,Red,US,"The power and richness of Port fill this extreme—and extremely delicious—Zinfandel.

12.8%,Red,US,"This complex Syrah has a surprisingly deep, dark red color, almost like a Port, but it's not nearly as heavy as it looks. It boasts intricate flavors, a firm but not fat structure, and signature cool-climate Syrah characteristics of black pepper, wood smoke, plum and grilled meat flavors. Medium-bodied and silky textured, it sips smoothly and leaves you wanting more. ",Cattleya 2012 Soberanes Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),94,70,California,Syrah
15.5%,Red,US,"This full-bodied and apparently sweet Zinfandel drinks more like a Port than a dry wine.

14.5%,Red,US,"Richness, ripeness and alcoholic strength all come together in this surprisingly smooth and Port-like wine. The very deep color stays black almost to the rim.

14.5%,Red,US,"The classic Port grape gets a showcase here: 100% varietal, aged in 50% new oak (half French, half American).

14.8%,Red,US,"Quite ripe—almost to the point of becoming Port-like—this offers scents of raisin and prune mixed with sweet spices.

14%,Red,Portugal,"Vinified in open stone lagars, this is a seriously dark and solid wine. It has the structure of a dry Port, very rich, rounded, kept together by firmer tannins.

14.5%,Red,Argentina,"As per usual, Privada displays qualities beyond its price point. This version of Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon is smoky on the nose, with charcoal, minerals and toast capping crusty berry aromas.

14%,Red,Portugal,"A powerful, concentrated wine, it has great density and structure. It shows the quality of the vintage, rich and fruity while preserving the elegance and poise that is typical of Chryseia.

N/A,Red,Portugal,"With a wine like this, you can see the connection between table wine and Port in the Douro. It's dry, but with its dried raisin flavors and structured tannins, it shares a Port-like character.

15.5%,Red,US,"High alcohol, to the tune of 15.5% by volume, is the defining element of this Zin. It gives heat and the sweet, glyceriney finish of a minor Port.

16.1%,Red,US,"High alcohol gives the wine heat, especially in the finish. It's also overripe, with the blackberries veering into port-like raisins and prunes.

14.2%,Red,US,"The blend here is 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Syrah, all from the Crawford vineyard. It carries some Port-like aromas of very ripe if not slightly over-ripe grapes, along with leafy components and accents of orange peel. A whiff of bourbon barrel sets up the sharp finish. ",Dusty Cellars 2009 DCW Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),86,25,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon
14.5%,Red,US,"The prune and raisin scents and flavors suggest that some of these grapes were picked past optimal ripeness.

15%,Red,US,"Made with a majority of Syrah and 4% Viognier, the Brawler is moody, dark, smoky, a mouthful of earthy tobacco and leather. Enjoy with Port or an after-dinner pipe, old-school. ",Prospect 772 2011 The Brawler Syrah (Sierra Foothills),88,36,California,Syrah
14.7%,Red,US,"The fruit on this Syrah is so ripe that the blackberries venture into raisins and prunes. With the glycerine from high alcohol, the wine tastes like a minor Port. ",Lafond 2010 Lafond Vineyard Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),82,40,California,Syrah
14.8%,Red,US,"High alcohol, with its burn and glyceriney sweetness, mars this otherwise good Syrah. The tannins are polished and smooth, the acidity brisk and clean, but the wine's raisiny, port-like finish detracts. ",Santa Barbara Winery 2011 Syrah (Sta. Rita Hills),84,20,California,Syrah

The Terrantez grape is the rarest of all the Madeira grapes and also produces the most long-lived wines with examples from the 18th century still drinkable.
